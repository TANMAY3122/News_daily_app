# NewsDaily App

The NewsDaily App is a comprehensive news application built using the Flutter framework. It allows users to stay up-to-date with the latest news from various sources around the world. The app utilizes a powerful news API to provide real-time news articles and headlines, ensuring that users are always informed about current events.




## Features

### 1. News Feed

The app's main screen presents users with a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate news feed. News articles are displayed in a clean and organized layout, making it convenient for users to quickly browse through the latest updates.

### 2. News Details

Tapping on a news article from the feed opens up the News Details screen. Here, users can find more in-depth information about the selected article. The details screen displays the article's title, summary, publication date, and the main content. Users can dive deeper into the news story to get a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

### 3. Read More

For users who want to explore the full news story on the source website, the app provides a "Read More" button within the News Details screen. When clicked, this button redirects the user to the original source of the news article, ensuring that they have access to the complete article.
